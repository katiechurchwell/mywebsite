# Personal Site
## Summary
Hello! Welcome to my personal site. This space will eventually be polished up and used professionally but for now it's a frankensteined mess of things I'm trying out when I have the time.

To see where I'm currently at, you can check out the deployed site [here](https://katiechurchwell.github.io/personal-site/landing-page).

## Aspirational features
- Using GAN to generate headshots each time the user refreshed the page.

- Parallax layout with dyanamic images depending on the weather of my current location. Maybe I make these?

Thanks for stopping by! :v:
