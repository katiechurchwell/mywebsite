# Personal Site
## Summary
Hello! Welcome to my personal site. This space will eventually be polished up and used professionally but for now it's a frankensteined mess of things I'm trying out when I have the time.

To see where I'm currently at, you can check out the deployed site [here](https://katiechurchwell.github.io/personal-site/landing.html).

## Aspirational Features
- Using GAN to generate headshots each time the user refreshes the page.
- Upgrade hero to something a bit cooler. Some ideas:
  - Dynamic based on current weather.
  - Parallax artwork.
  - P5.js artwork with movement.

Thanks for stopping by! :v:
