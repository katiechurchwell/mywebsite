Welcome! This is a page to showcase some of my web development projects.

## How to Use
In the terminal, run the following:
- To install dependencies: `npm run install`
- To run in development: `npm run develop`
- To build production: `npm run build`

## Design
*Currently looking for recommendantions for a server hosting solution (due to Heroku eliminating free plans)!*


The landing page graphic is generated through the [Windy Webcams API](https://api.windy.com/webcams). A fetch is made for the webcam image that is narrowed down by mountain category and the OR, US region. One of the results is randomly chosen and a blue noise filter is overlayed on top to try and counteract some of the jpeggyness.

The tech stack page utilizes the [GitHub Graphql API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql) to filter my GitHub repositories by topic. 

## Aspirational Features
Before refactoring in React, I had used two other JavaScript tools called [Color Thief](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/) and [Name That Color](https://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/#6195ED) to take the average color from the webcam image and define the name. When I am less lazy I'll add that feature back in because it was pretty cool.

Thanks for stopping by! :v:
